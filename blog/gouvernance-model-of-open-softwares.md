title: How do open source software organize themself ?

Cool and CoolLab are open source softwares (and even free software, see this **article** for more informations **INSERER LIEN ARTICLE** ) meaning their source code - how the program is written in binary or in programming languages - is available for anyone **having a copy of the software**. In consequence, any willing developers can use, modify and redistribute the software. Thus, programmers having access to the source code can change a program by adding to it, changing it or fixing parts that are non working properly. Oftenly, open source software comes with a specific license, specifying precisely to what extent these modifications or redistributions can be done - for instance, one may prohibit a commercial use of their products, or someone copying a version of their code to sell it online. <br></br>
In our case, CoolLab is provided with a [MIT license](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Cool/blob/main/LICENSE), allowing any modification, use or selling, without charge to anyone having a copy of the software - [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Cool). Whatever you wanna do, you can.  
 
Open source software often begins that way : a single person, or a bunch of developers wants to make a specific program. They begin to develop it, and end up proposing it to anyone. Little by little, a community forms itself around the project, and people that were not involved in the project at the beginning start to write some code, new features, propose new designs and ideas, fix bugs : open software is the result of communities of developers. Unlike to companies though, communities are horizontal, everyone can contribute (with a peer-review system of course), and there is, no president, no **appointed** authority to resolve conflicts, lead development choices, and no communication hierarchy, more and more necessary as the project rises in size, and so in possibilities. How do you handle this situation ? How do you organize an open source community based work ? \EST CE QUE CE NE SERAIT PAS L'INTRO DE CETTE ARTICLE ?\

### Founder-leader or Benevolent Dictator for life
 
One may say this "power" would logicaly belong to the initiator of the project, and sometimes this is what happens. The initial creator of the project became what is commonly called "Benevolent Dictator for life" (BDFL), meaning they will define the general orientation of the project. This term is used as a joke, because if in fact the BDFL has dictator-like powers over the project, this power originated from the trust people in the community have in them. The benevolent dictator only has responsibilities because people lend confidence to them. As examples, they are Linus Torvalds (linux's kernel creator), Guido Van Rossum (Python's creator) and [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life). These conception prevails a lot in small projects, as the founder is naturally leading all the coding and designing process. (\design ?) It also allows far quicker decision making, as the BDFL doesn't have to go for the consensus with the developers community. Yet, it can be source of conflicts, all the more if the BDFL has a toxic behavior or management despite all its authority : you can read more [here](https://www.cmswire.com/information-management/is-the-end-of-the-benevolent-dictator-for-life-in-open-source-software-here/).
 
### The "Appointed Committee decides everything" model
 
Sometimes, the community members can appoint one or several leadership groups, each one ruling a specific part of the project (UI, Rendering, UX, AI ...), similarly to how a company works a its board of directors, and a split in differents fields of competences, each division having its own hierarchy. There are various manners to select these committees. They can be officially elected, as among associations, with the risk of a long and tedious process and a lack of participation. They can also be implicitly choosed : the most contributing (and so implied) people will little by little take on more and more responsibilities and tasks. Thus, this tacit governance model can be observed in the community interaction : who reviews, commits, communicates the most. The harder you work, the more decisions you take, it is sometimes called a **do-ocracy**.
 
### The Foundation model
 
Some open source projects choose to be managed by a non profitable organization so as to officially state the project is not made to be lucrative, and is the result of a community, not a company. Moreover, a foundation can also be used to promote broader purposes than just the management of its programs. The Blender foundation, for instance, is not only in charge of the development of the eponymous software, but to "give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core", with in addition to Blender, assets, community-driven add-on etc...
Foundations aren't necessarily the sole ruling instance : they are sometimes created when a project becomes too wide to handle every non technical topic - conference, communication, juridic matters, search for funds - while committees will still lead the development work.
 
### Entreprises-driven project
 
Nowadays, more and more open source projects are released by companies. The reasons are numerous : lower maintenance costs - as the community will contribute to fix bugs, reach potential developers and users, support a development ecosystem (add-on, development of another open source  existing technology). A common drawback to this model is the stern control ensured by the company. For somes software, non-employed developers can't directly collaborate to the project or have to follow a very strict procedure : it's closer to a "free" product delivered by a company than a genuine community work, but it is not the case for all the "companies-baked" projects.
