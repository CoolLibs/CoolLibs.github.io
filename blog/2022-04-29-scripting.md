You can now write scripts to control CoolLab. Everything that you can do in the UI in now also doable through scripts.<br/>
Moreover, you can write those scripts in **_the language of your choice_**! That's right, **_every_** language in the world will do, even the one you wrote last weekend and that only you possesses an interpreter for.

All of this magic relies on a well knwown friend: **the HTTP protocol**.

We provide an API that anyone can call; as long as you know how to make http requests from your language, you can write scripts for CoolLab.
