Remove dependency on a backend, let users implement it the way they like, and provide implementations for popluar backend.

I was scared to generalize my _cam_ library because I thought I would need to use template, and know how to get the transpose of a matric for example. But this is much simpler, flexible, and does come with all the annoyances of templates (all the code in headers, harder for ides to handle)

I don't know if its fait to call it that way; don't know if others do the same;.
