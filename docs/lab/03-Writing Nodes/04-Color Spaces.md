All our user inputs are in **sRGB, straight alpha** space.<br/>
BUT when the shader asks for some *RGB* or *RGBA*, we use **linear RGB and premultiplied alpha**. Using premultiplied alpha means that things like blending and blurring will behave naturally ([see this great lesson](https://youtu.be/WtYfF48Z9mA?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz2emSh0UQ5iOdT2xRHFHL7E&t=960)). Linear RGB is better for most computations (see [this](https://youtu.be/LKnqECcg6Gw) (and also [this](https://youtu.be/nIaczt4F2D4) to see why Lab is even better)). Light-based effects should be done in linear (blur, chromatic aberration, addition, over, etc.); color-distance based effects should be done in Lab (gradient, mapping a color to the closest one in a set, etc.)

NB: for RGB->RGB effects, if some RGBA is plugged in as input, we first un-premultiply the RGB, then pass it to the effect, then re-premultiply. This is the same behavior as ["Pre-Divide / Post-Multiply" in Resolve/Fusion](https://youtu.be/klqSJiPqmGU). This basically means that everything will work as expected intuitively and you don't have to worry about it.
