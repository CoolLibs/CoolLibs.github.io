## Use cases

- Split an image into several ones based on regions of similar brightness, then display those images on planes in 3D that are offset along the Z axis (cf Rom1)
- Stained glass: run a shader that creates distinct regions, then colorize those regions, then compute edges, then magnify those edges (blur + threshold), then add them back on top of the image. Then bloom on a given part of the image.
