[**CoolLab**](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Lab) is a patchwork of creative tools based on _Cool_. It is designed to do all kind of precedural image generation work and will include some audio handling too one day.

The goal is to have both a software that uses _Cool_ so that we can work on the framework, and also to develop a genuinely cool software for artists and programmers.

My personal goal is to be able to produce abstract music videos with it.<br/>
