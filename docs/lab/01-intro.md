[**CoolLab**](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Lab) is a patchwork of creative tools based on _Cool_. It is mainly focused on image and video generation, and includes some audio as well.

The goal is both to have a software that uses _Cool_ so that we can work on the framework, and also to develop a genuinely cool software for artists and programmers.

My personal goal is to be able to produce abstract music videos with it.

A few inspirations:
