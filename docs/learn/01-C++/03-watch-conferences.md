Once you have a good mastery of C++, watching conferences is what will take you to the next level! Don't worry if the first ones are hard for you to understand, you will learn as you watch more and more, and before you realize you will have learned a ton!

You can find a list of amazing conferences to watch [right here](https://julesfouchy.github.io/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/resources/#conferences). Watching them in the proposed order is a good strategy.
