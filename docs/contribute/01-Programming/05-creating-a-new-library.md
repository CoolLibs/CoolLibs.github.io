title: Creating a new library
---

## Brief

If you are about to create a small system that doesn't have any dependencies on the rest of *Cool*, then making it into a standalone library makes sense.<br/>
We try to do that whenever possible because it encourages a more decoupled and flexible design, and makes it easily reusable by others without having to include the whole of *Cool*.

## How to

- Create a new repository from [our template](https://github.com/CoolLibs/library-template)
- Replace "mylib" with the name of the library all over the place in the newly created repo
