You can find our To-Do list [here](https://github.com/orgs/CoolLibs/projects/1/views/2).

Create a "gitignored" folder a save a "test.clb" project there. It will then automatically be saved whenever you make changes to it, and opened whenever you open Coollab. This allows you to keep your test setup upon restarting Coollab.
