title: Tasks

You can view and manage all the tasks [on our GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/CoolLibs/projects/1/views/3).

Don't hesitate to add tasks there to help you keep track of your work and ideas. For example if you have an idea for a post on social medias, write it down before you forget it. It will also allow you to add details about it later if you need to. Also, having a list of all the things that have already been done can be very useful to future people who will work on our communication.
