title: Tasks
---

This is here to list of all that are to be done regarding our communication plan. It is also a great place to leave notes about each task: good advice, things to avoid, links to helpful articles / conferences. Think about the people that will come after you (and even yourself in the future) and write down everything that might be useful to achieve a given task!

| 🔭  | To Do                 |
| 👀  | To Do Next, Important |
| 🚧  | Work in Progress      |
| ✅  | Done                  |
| 🔄  | To be done repeatedly | <!-- NB: don't use ♻️ because it is green like ✅ but has a very different meaning: ✅ can be ignored, while 🔄 requires an action, so distinguishing by the color is great.  --> |
