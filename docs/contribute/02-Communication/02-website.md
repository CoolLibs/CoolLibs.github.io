## The *markdown* syntax

-> You can preview with little button in the top-right

If you want to see everything that's available, go [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Viewing your local modifications before pushing them online

[Open a terminal](get-started#open-a-terminal) and type

```
npm start
```

## Get the latest updates from other members (*Pull*)

## Upload your modifications (*Push*)

They will be visible on the website! (after a few minutes, you can see the progress [here](https://github.com/CoolLibs/CoolLibs.github.io/actions), if it red, you did something wrong! (probably a broken link))

If you want to share modifs with others, or ask for a review, you can push, but *on a separate branch*. See the next section.
TODO: do bat scripts to simplify this process ?
> Simpler: put _ before your file name, those do not appear on the website (but be aware that they are still visible on our GitHub page, so don't put anything secret in them!)
