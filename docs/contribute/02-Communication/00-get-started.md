## Join the Discord

## Get added to the GitHub organization

This will allow you to modify [the tasks list](https://github.com/orgs/CoolLibs/projects/1/views/3) and this website.

If you don't already have one: [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/).<br/>
Then ask an admin (Jules Fouchy) to add you to the organization: provide them your GitHub username.

## Install

To edit the website, install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Then install those extensions for VS Code: git, markdown.

## Download the website sources

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CoolLibs/CoolLibs.github.io
```

```
npm install
```
