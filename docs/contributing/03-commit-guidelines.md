## Make a lot of a small commits

As soon as you have made meaningful progress and the code compiles, make a commit !

Try to avoid long lists of *unrelated* changes in a single commit.

## Message style

Be explicit. Don't strip words from your sentence.

When appropriate, specify inside [ ] which class / method / file is modified by the commit.

Example commit message :
```
[NodeEditor] Generate sceneSDF from the nodes
```
